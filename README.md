This Python code implements a simple linear regression model using the gradient descent algorithm. The primary functions include "cost_function" for calculating the mean squared error, "gradient" for computing the gradient of the cost function, and "gradient_descent" for iteratively updating model parameters to minimize the cost. To use the code, import the functions, define input features and target values, and execute the gradient descent function. The code is designed for educational purposes and provides a foundational understanding of linear regression optimization.
