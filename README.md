This project involves the development of a linear regression model using the gradient descent algorithm, implemented in Python. The core components of the project include the `cost_function`, which calculates the mean squared error to evaluate the model's performance, and the `gradient` function, responsible for computing the gradient of the cost function to direct parameter updates. The `gradient_descent` function is the model's engine, iteratively adjusting parameters to minimize the cost and enhance accuracy. Designed as an educational project, it offers a hands-on approach to understanding linear regression and optimization techniques. To apply the model, simply import the provided functions, define your input features and target values, and run the `gradient_descent` function.
